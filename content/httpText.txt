An HTTP server is a software application that processes incoming HTTP requests and delivers web pages, files, or data in response. When a client, such as a web browser, sends a request for a webpage or resource, the HTTP server listens on a specified port, processes the request, and returns the appropriate content, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or data in JSON format.

Commonly used HTTP servers include **Apache**, **Nginx**, and **Node.js**-based servers like **Express.js**. These servers support various HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to handle different types of requests. HTTP servers also manage session handling, request routing, and load balancing for optimized performance.

In summary, the HTTP server acts as the backbone of modern web communication, enabling the seamless transfer of information between the client and server over the web.
